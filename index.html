							Mark Shelgren was born in Buffalo, New York, many moons ago. Mark
							has a B.A. degree in Philosophy from MacMurray College and an MBA
							degree from Northern Illinois University.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mark plays handball and golf, enjoys yoga, anything at the beach
							and drinking beer. Mark has lived all over the United States and
							currently resides in Foothill Ranch, CA. Mark and his family lived
							in France for a year when Mark was in high school. Consequently
							Mark reads and speaks french fluently. He wishes he was fluent in
							javascript.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mark has been married for 36 years to his wife Debbie. They have
							two daughters and three grand children, all male. Mark thinks all
							three of his grandson's should be taking the Full Stack
							Development Bootcamp.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mark currently leads a small software services company
							specializing in SAP. SAP is an ERP business transaction processing
							system with its own programming language, ABAP. SAP is used mostly
							by larger, multi-national organizations built on a three tiered
							client server architecture.
						</p>

						<p>
							In 1999, SAP responded to the Internet and new economy by
							launching its mysap.com strategy. Ten years later, the company
							branched out into three markets of the future: mobile technology,
							database technology, and cloud. To rapidly become a key player in
							these new domains, SAP acquired some of its competitors, including
							Business Objects, Sybase, Ariba, SuccessFactors, and Concur.

						Today, SAP builds solutions for the Internet of Things and machine
						learning, for complex analyses and blockchain. SAP HANA is now
						available on the three largest public cloud platforms. The companyâ€™s
						integrated applications connect all parts of a business into an
						intelligent suite on a digital platform. SAP has more than 215
						million cloud users currently, more than 100 solutions covering all
						business functions, and the largest cloud portfolio of any provider.
						SAP operates 69 data centers at35 locations in 15
						countries.19722011201919871999

					<p>
						Mark Shelgren does not have the resources or ability to simply
						purchase the new skills and education required to support the
						transition to the internet economy. For the past several years, he
						has been self-learning, trying to figure out the nuances and
						functionality of the tools and environment of the internet of things
						and how to help his customers realize the benefits.
					</p>
					<p>Thus Mark signed up for the Full Stack Development Bootcamp.</p>
